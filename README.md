Final Project for Winter 2018 CSCB58 by Stanley and Derek

Minigame Collection: consists of 2 minigames:
  1) Memory Sequence Game
  2) Decimal-To-Binary Conversion Game

Memory Sequence Game: Four LEDRs light up in some sequence, and the player's objective is to flip the corresponding switches in the correct order.

Decimal-To-Binary Conversion Game: A three-digit (or less) decimal number will appear by the HEX displays, and the player's objective is to flip the switches so that the number's binary representation is equivalent to the decimal representation.

Both games have a scoring system that increments by one on each completed stage, and they also have reset buttons as well as a timer that counts down from 60.
